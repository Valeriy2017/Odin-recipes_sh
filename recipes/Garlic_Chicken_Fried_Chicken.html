    <h2>Описание</h2>
    <p> This actually uses my breading for Chicken Fried Steak---my husband suggested we try it with chicken breasts, and it was delicious!</p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg..</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon slices to a paper-towel-lined plate. Reserve 2 tablespoons drippings in the skillet. Add onion and brown sugar and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is golden, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Editor's Note</h5>
    <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.</p>
