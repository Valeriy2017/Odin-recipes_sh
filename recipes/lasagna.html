    <h2>Описание</h2>
    <p> This satisfying, quick-cooking, one-skillet chicken dish combines crispy bacon, caramelized onions, and gooey shredded cheese; and clean-up is a breeze!</p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 strips bacon</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle chicken with salt and lemon pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 13 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon slices to a paper-towel-lined plate. Reserve 2 tablespoons drippings in the skillet. Add onion and brown sugar and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is golden, about 5 minutes.</li>
